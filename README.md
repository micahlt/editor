# Groove Editor

Groove is a web-based, visual programming editor.  Users can create sprites and sounds and drag
blocks together to build programs. The editor is forked from blocky, all other code is made from scratch.
All code is free and open source.

The project page/editor is https://grooveprogramming.github.io/editor

Creating custom blocks https://developers.google.com/blockly/guides/create-custom-blocks/overview

### Planned Features:

* The editor will fill the whole screen when you open a script from the assets.
* The blocks will be split up into different categories (in concept art).
* Scripts can be named (in concept art).
* Something like [@Griffpatch's scratch developer tools](https://github.com/griffpatch/Scratch3-Dev-Tools) will be built in (in concept art).
